        <h2>Understanding React Hooks</h2>
        <p>React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 to allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know.</p>

        <h3>Core Hooks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>useState:</strong> Manages local state in functional components.</li>
            <li><strong>useEffect:</strong> Handles side effects like data fetching and subscriptions.</li>
            <li><strong>useContext:</strong> Consumes React context without nesting.</li>
            <li><strong>useReducer:</strong> Manages complex state logic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Custom Hooks</h3>
        <p>Custom hooks allow you to extract component logic into reusable functions. This promotes code reuse and makes your components cleaner and more maintainable.</p>

        <h3>Best Practices</h3>
        <p>When using hooks, remember to follow the rules of hooks: only call hooks at the top level and only call hooks from React functions. This ensures that hooks work correctly and predictably.</p>
